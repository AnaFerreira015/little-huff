# Huffman Project

In computer science and information theory, a Huffman code is a particular type of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression. The process of finding or using such a code proceeds by means of Huffman coding, an algorithm developed by David A. Huffman while he was a Sc.D. student at MIT, and published in the 1952 paper "A Method for the Construction of Minimum-Redundancy Codes".

This project is being developed jointly during the discipline *data structure 2019.1* by the students:
* [Ana Ferreira](https://github.com/AnaFerreira015)
* Gabriel CÃ©sar
* [Kelly Bianca](https://github.com/kellybianca)
* Marcos Ivan

The following libraries were developed to make the code simpler to understand, each library dealing with a different data type or with functions that have a common goal:
1. Hash Table (hash.h)
2. Priority Queue (priority_queue.h)
3. Double Linked List
